# The Programmatic Oath 2015-0.0.1

## What is it?
There has been discussion in various forms[1] that those of us that write code
need to have a code of our own. A set of guiding principals that we strive to
adhere to. This would be the same sort of code as the Hippocratic Oath.

This is not meant to be a general statement like "Don't be evil", however it
should help guide folks toward that end. This should also not be a detailed set
of rules defining every aspect and process of programming, but it should help
people make the right choices.

Writing good code isn't just about programming. Common sense isn't always
common. Think of this document as a moral linter.

## Is it binding?
No. There is no force that can bind you to this oath other than the disrespect 
of your peers should you stray without A Darn Good Reason.

## Can I change the bits I don't like?
Of course you can. That's why it's here. I will act as editor for the time
being, but I hope that eventually other, wiser folk will step in. Feel free to
submit PRs

Should you disagree with everyone, you're free to fork and improve the way that
you see fit. I'd appreciate if you called it something different.
