# The Programmatic Oath 2015-0.0.1

First, I will code no harm; I will create code I will want to run myself, on my
own systems, that my own life will depend upon.

I shall neither act in bad faith nor shall I condone such acts. If I would not
want such acts performed upon myself, I shall not perform or let those acts be
performed.

I will seek transparency where possible, for that makes my code better.

I shall seek to make my code safe from attack and respectful of those that use
it. I will not seek to confuse or misguide the user, nor shall I use the data
the user has entrusted to me in ways that were not clearly stated before I was
entrusted with this data.

I will allow for my own health, because that makes my code better.

I will seek to learn and teach in equal amounts. My code will be reviewed and I
will welcome questions and comments.

I  will respect criticism of my work as an opportunity to improve, not as a
personal attack.

I will guide those that seek knowledge and recognize that I am not all knowing.
It is by teaching that I learn. It is by learning that I understand. It is by
understanding that I solve.

I will communicate with others better than I communicate with myself.
I will not speak harshly to a person, rather I will say nothing.

I will understand that while someone may not know what I do, they may know much
which I do not. I will treat misunderstanding as an opportunity to teach.
